# 🏠 Home Credit  Risk Model Pipeline

Welcome to our advanced pipeline for building and assessing credit risk models using machine learning! 📊💳

## Overview 📝
Discover a comprehensive approach to constructing credit risk models. We employ various machine learning algorithms like LightGBM and CatBoost, alongside ensemble techniques for robust predictions. Our pipeline emphasizes data integrity, feature relevance, and model stability, crucial elements in credit risk assessment. 🛠️💼

## Features 🚀
- **Data Preprocessing**: Begin with cleaning data, handling missing values, and optimizing memory usage for efficient computation.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful insights from data using advanced techniques, enhancing model predictive power.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models such as LightGBM and CatBoost to capture complex relationships and patterns.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combine predictions from various models using our custom Voting Model to achieve higher accuracy and stability. 🤝📈
